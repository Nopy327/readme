im surprised u actually clicked on my readme.md, how funny, you can tell that i dont know how to make it appear big on my profile oh well.
im guessing you want something from me then,

alright well,

Interests: #1 Animating (MMD, SFM, Garry's mod, Blender) #2 Language learning (Duolingo, Youtube) #3 Coding (Website making, Game making, Hacking) #4 Psychology (psychology of supermarkets is a must watch video 100% (≧∇≦)ﾉ ) #5 Martial-arts (Kung fu)

if i feel bad, i usually do something silly like play video games or watch anime. thats rare tho. i enjoy learning/growing more than playing games.
