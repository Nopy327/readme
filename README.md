hi
uuuhhhh... am i supposed to say something here?

alright well,

Interests: Animating (MMD, SFM, Garry's mod, Blender), Language learning (Duolingo, Youtube), Coding (Website making, Game making, Hacking)

if i feel bad, i usually do something silly like play video games or watch anime. thats rare tho. i enjoy learning/growing more than playing games.
